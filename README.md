# StreamlineDining

Dining Scheduler for UNT Hackathon 2023

## *Inspiration*
Our inspiration for StreamlineDine came from a deep concern for the challenges college students face in managing their time efficiently while also addressing the issue of food wastage on campus. We observed the long queues at dining facilities and the frequent food wastage that occurred due to overproduction. This sparked the idea of creating a solution that not only saves time for students but also contributes to reducing food wastage.
## *How we built it*
StreamlineDine was meticulously crafted using React.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. The front-end ensures a responsive and intuitive user interface, while the back-end handles server-side scripting and data management. User authentication and real-time notifications were implemented to enhance security and user experience.

## *Challenges we ran into*
The development of StreamlineDine presented several challenges. Coordinating with multiple dining facilities and integrating the platform seamlessly into their operations required effective communication and problem-solving skills. Optimizing the platform for scalability and addressing technical issues related to real-time notifications and database synchronization were also significant hurdles.

## *Accomplishments that we're proud of*
We take pride in successfully creating a user-friendly platform that addresses a real need on college campuses. StreamlineDine's ability to save time for students, improve the efficiency of dining facilities, and contribute to the reduction of food wastage represents a significant accomplishment for our team. Overcoming technical challenges and establishing effective collaborations with stakeholders further highlight our achievements.

## *What we learned*
The development of StreamlineDine provided us with valuable insights into user-centric design, effective communication with stakeholders, and the technical intricacies of web development. We learned the importance of adaptability in the face of challenges and the significance of user feedback in refining and improving our platform.
##*What's next for Streamlining Campus Dining*
Our vision for StreamlineDine extends beyond the current capabilities, and one exciting avenue we are exploring is online ordering. Recognizing the evolving trends and preferences of today's students, we aim to introduce a seamless online ordering system to complement our existing platform.
